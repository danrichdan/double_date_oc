<h3>2016.11.nn - Title</h3>

<h3>2016.11.19 - Login Service Complete</h3>
<h4>&mdash; by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>The login_service is complete. I have created a proto_login_controller that can serve as a template for
creating the real login_controller when we are ready. I have also created a proto_login_page.html that can
serve as a template for the real login page; it also provides a test harness for the login_service, so I can
make sure it is working. The back end login_handler.php still has hard-coded data, so look in there for the
login information. This will be sufficient for now, so we don't have to make copies of the database while
it is still being developed.</p>

<h3>2016.11.17 - To Angular Material or not To Angular Material?</h3>
<h4>&mdash; by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>Junie is prototyping the first two pages, and Dan is prototyping the Angular routing for a one-page app.
Besides the look-and-feel, Junie looking into whether we can/should use Angular Material for the responsive
part of the design. We will need to decide this in the next few working days, or decide that we are going to
user Bootstrap for the responsive portion.</p>

<h3>2016.11.17 - Ahh, Minions</h3>
<h4>&mdash; by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>We have four new minions from the next cohort: Sean, Cung, Brian, and Vernon.  We don't have a lot for them
to do yet, but we have set them on reviewing the design document draft and making comments.</p>

<h3>2016.11.16 - Simplification and the Soft Hook</h3>
<h4>&mdash; by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>After a long meeting with Eric and then separately, the app has morphed significantly. Based primarily on
Eric's experience, we have to shoot for a much simpler first-user experience: only a few clicks required to
get some response from the server. Dan, Junie, and I are working through the new-user flows to make this as
painless as possible for the user. Of course that means we are jettisoning most of the filters, becuase the
more we ask, the more chance we have where the user will just say, "to hell with it."</p>

<h3>2016.11.15 - Farmers Only - City Folk Just Don't Understand</h3>
<h4>&mdash; by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>I am now Wayne W. on FarmersOnly.com, and boy, there are some interesting women on there. My personal
favorite was one that posed holding up the head of a buck she had just shot, by the horns of course. I don't
see a lot of new information to learn from this site; we have this basically covered.</p>

<h3>2016.11.11 - This is a Lot of Data</h3>
<h4>&mdash; by Wade Wooldridge</h4>
<p>We have a lot of filters, including smoking, drinking, drugs, and religion. I don't know if we can even do a
mobile version of this app with all the data to be displayed and chosen.</p>
