This is the LearningFuze Cohort 11 project called DoubleDate.

# Basic Setup
* Database setup for localhost (using phpMySql)
 * Copy user/connect_database.php.config to user/connect_database.php, and edit for your MySQL account and password.
 * Create a database at the top level named double_date.
 * Import the file tables/users.sql to create the users database.
 * Import the file tables/profiles.sql to create the profiles database.
 * Import the file tables/zipcodes.sql to create the zipcodes database.
* MAMP Setup
 * Do not try to run the utility directly from PhpStorm.
 * Point the MAMP server at lfz/c11_doubledate so it can find the back end.
