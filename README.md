# c11_doubledate
This is the LearningFuze Cohort 11 project called DoubleDate.

# Basic Setup
* Database setup for localhost (using phpMySql)
** Copy user/connect_database.php.config to user/connect_database.php, and edit for your MySQL account and password.
** Create a database at the top level named double_date.
** Rename tables/users.sql_six_users to users.sql.
** Import the file tables/users.sql to create the users database with six records.
* MAMP Setup
** Do not try to run the utility directly from PhpStorm.
** Point the MAMP server at lfz/c11_doubledate so it can find the back end.
** Browse to localhost/proto_user_page.html to run the user interface.
** TBD: main application.
