                                <p>DoubleDateOC is a web site for matching up couples with other couples in their area for shared activities.  You put in a minimal amount of information, like your age, zip code and interests, and we match you up to other couples with a similar age, location, and shared interests.</p>

                                So it’s like a dating site?

                                <p>Well, yes and no. It is like a dating site in that we are trying to match up people, but it is different in two important aspects. First, we are trying to match up couples with other couples. Second, dating sites are trying for the two extremes of either finding sex tonight or finding “the one” to love forever. DoubleDateOC is in the middle: trying to find another couple to have shared non-sexual activities with. Hopefully this will be ongoing in a new friendship.</p>

                                <p>Orange County is just the test market. That gives us plenty of other couples to match you up with, and allows us to work out any problems in the system before we go national or international.</p>

                                <p>We try to ask for a minimum of information. We are only asking for your first names, age range, and zip code for location. That is because most couples want to be matched up with other couples in the same approximate area and the same approximate age range. We ask for a photo and a paragraph describing you, so other couples can have something to help select based on. We ask for an e-mail so that we can notify couples when they are matched.</p>

                                <p>You will automatically be matched against every other active couple in the database, on the following criteria:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Age: each couple puts in their age range, and the age range they are looking for, and these are matched you-to-them and them-to-you.</li>
                                    <li>Location: each couple puts in their zip code, and the distance range they are willing to go, and these are matched you-to-them and them-to-you.</li>
                                    <li>Interests: each couple marks the interests that they want to share with other couples. The more common interests you have with another couple, the higher the rating you have as a match.</li>
                                    <li>Personal selection: Based on the three criteria above, you will be shown potential matches where meet the age and location requirements, and where you have the most shared interests. At that point, you will be shown the first names, profile picture, and profile paragraph of the other couple, along with the common interests. You will be allowed to give a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down”. It is only when two couples give the “thumbs up” to each other that the e-mails are sent out.</li>

                                <p>When you are a first-time user and putting in the basic zip code and age and interests, DoubleDate does a search for “sample matches” that meet these criteria.  DoubleDate will not reveal the profile of other couples until you have completed the registration process, and will not reveal the e-mail address of another couple until you have approved of them and they have approved of you.</p>

                                <p>The DoubleDateOC match finder runs in the background, and you should expect to see your first potential matches show up within one hour; check back after one hour to see your first potential matches. Bear in mind that DoubleDateOC is a new service that is currently ramping up. You should expect to see more matches in the near future. Check back in a few days and see what new potential matches we have identified. Also, you might expand your age range(s) and the number of interests you have selected.</p>

As part of sending out a mutual match, DoubleDateOC will send you an e-mail advising you of the other couple’s e-mail address, and send the other couple an e-mail advising them of your e-mail address. Then the two couples can make arrangements to get together.</p>
